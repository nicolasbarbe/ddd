= Introduction

The EventStore API is ... bla bla bla

== HTTP verbs

The EventStore API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource, overwrites all fields

| `PATCH`
| Used for partial updates to an existing resource

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

== HTTP status codes

The Example API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes. For example,

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist

| `405 Method Not Allowed`
| The type of request for this resource is not allowed. For example, some endpoints may be GET only.
Trying a POST will return this message.
|===

For more status codes, see the https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html[w3 standard]

== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

include::{snippets}/error-unknown-stream/response-fields.adoc[]

For example, a request that attempts to return the events of a non-existing stream returns a `404 Not Found` response:

operation::error-unknown-stream[snippets='curl-request,http-request,http-response']
